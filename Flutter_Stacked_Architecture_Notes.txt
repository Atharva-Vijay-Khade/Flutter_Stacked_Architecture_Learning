//Notes on Stacked Architecture 

Stacked Architecture is completely based on 3 main concepts
-> View
-> ViewModel
-> Services

# Package Used for this Architecture is the stacked package 

View 
-> This is the place where we actually create a ui for our app
-> This field is bind with the ViewModel
-> When the UI needs to rebuild then it's done with help of ViewModel
-> View to ViewModel is process like : View says to ViewModel: " hey load the UI again
or provide me with some service, then the ViewModel does it for the View"

ViewModel
-> This actullay has the fields which will get loaded on the UI
-> These fields are called from the View where the view builder builds the view
then in the ViewModelBuilder in View this ViewModle Builder is given as property value
to bind it with view

NotifyListeners and Reactive/Nonreactive
-> The notifyListeners is the function which is called in the ViewModel at the place
where we want to rebuild the UI
-> if the constructor method in the View is reactive then the UI will load each time
the notifyListeners is called
-> but if the method is nonReactive then when the notifyListeners are called the data will
be changed but it won't be loaded onto the UI until it's reloaded by hot reload or routing

# Package Used for auto routing 
auto_route:  in dependencies {used to generate auto route functions that we used to write by hand}
we also requrire {these are dev dependencies}
build_runner:
auto_route_generator: 
to complete the setup for the auto_route: package

-> More on auto_route: https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route
-> it requires a minimal amount of code to generate everything needed for navigation inside of your App.
-> Using auto_route we can simply the routing process, we can avoid huge boilerplate codes,
auto routes does it for us effectively
